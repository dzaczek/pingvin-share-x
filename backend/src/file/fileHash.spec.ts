// An admin can ask for a file's sha256 so they can look it up on VirusTotal.
// Two things about that are worth holding still.

// The digest has to be the real one: a wrong hash does not fail loudly, it
// sends the admin to a VirusTotal page about some other file, or about
// nothing, and looks like an answer either way.
//
// And the route has to stay shut to everyone else. That is not obvious here,
// because JwtGuard in front of it lets an unauthenticated request through
// whenever allowUnauthenticatedShares is on, which this instance has on. The
// only thing standing between an anonymous caller and a loop of full file
// reads is the admin guard, so it is tested directly.
